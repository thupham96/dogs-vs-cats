# Dogs vs Cats
## by Thu Pham


## Dataset

>  The train folder contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats. Each image in this folder has the label as part of the filename. The test folder contains 12,500 images, named according to a numeric id. For each image in the test set, I will try to predict a probability that the image is a dog (1 = dog, 0 = cat).


## Important Findings

- The 1st model has 6 layers with filters 32 for Conv2D layer. The training accuracy is 81.16%. The validation accuracy is 72.55%. The Kaggle score is 1.44.
- The 2nd model has 6 layers with filters 64 for Conv2D layer. The training accuracy is 75.47%. The validation accuracy is 71.59%. The Kaggle score is 1.31.
- The 3rd model has 9 layers with filters 32 for Conv2D layers. The training accuracy is 83.79%. The validation accuracy is 75.83%. The Kaggle score is 1.64.
- The 4th model has 9 layers with filters 32 for Conv2D layers. The training accuracy is 85.87%. The validation accuracy is 79.07%. The Kaggle score is 2.25.
